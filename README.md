# Introduction

This is a reimplementation of the [MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet)](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/megnet)
and [3-body MEGNet (m3gnet)](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/m3gnet) in DGL in an effort to
improve its extensibility and scalability. The original MEGNet and M3GNet were implemented in TensorFlow. It is a
collaboration between the Materials Virtual Lab and Intel Labs (Santiago Miret, Marcel Nassar, Carmelo Gonzales).

# Status

This repository is still a work in progress. At the present moment, only the MEGNet architecture has been implemented.
We are still extensively testing the implementation. The plan is to complete implementation of M3GNet by end of 2022.

For users wishing to use the pre-trained models as-is, we recommend you check out the official [MEGNet](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/megnet)
and [M3GNet](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/m3gnet) implementations. For new users wishing to train new MEGNet
models, we welcome you to use this DGL implementation. Any contributions, e.g., code improvements or issue reports, are
very welcome!
